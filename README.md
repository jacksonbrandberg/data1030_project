# Predicting Forest Cover Types in the Roosevelt National Forest

This project uses data collected from land samples in the Roosevelt National Forest to predict the type of forest covering that will be present given surrounding geological features. A total of three models were employed: Logistic Regression, kNN, and XGBoost. F beta scores were used to evaluate these models given that the target variable, cover type, was imbalanced. The following versions and packages were used in model development: <br>
Python: 3.7.8<br>
numpy: 1.18.5<br>
matplotlib: 3.2.2<br>
pandas: 1.0.5<br>
xgboost: 1.1.1
